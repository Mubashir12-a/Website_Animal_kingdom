          <p>
            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living member of the cat
            family, the Felidae. It feeds by hunting. It lives in Asia, mainly
            India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia,
            Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Korea and Siberian Russia.
            Tigers are solitary animals.

            Cats are four-legged mammals with fur, soft paws, and attentive
            ears. They can be black, white, grey, orange, or a mix of these
            colors. Their fur protects them from the cold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cats are carnivores that hunt small animals in the wild. They use
            their sharp claws and teeth to kill prey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cats communicate through vocalizations like meowing, purring,
            trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting. They also use body
            language.

          <h3>ZZ plant</h3>
          <p>
            The ZZ plant (*Zamioculcas zamiifolia*) is a popular houseplant
            known for its glossy, dark green leaves and resilience. It can
            tolerate low light, infrequent watering, and neglect, making it
            perfect for beginners. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that store
            water, helping it survive in dry conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            ZZ plants are also air-purifying and help remove toxins like xylene
            and toluene from indoor spaces. They're slow-growing but can reach
            up to 3 feet in height. Despite their hardiness, overwatering can
            lead to root rot, so it's best to let the soil dry out between
            waterings.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info_2-box">
          <h3>Snake Plant</h3>
          <p>
            The Snake Plant, also known as *Sansevieria* or *Mother-in-Law's
            Tongue*, is a hardy, low-maintenance indoor plant known for its
            upright, sword-like leaves that can vary in color from green to
            yellow-edged. It is an excellent choice for beginners due to its
            ability to survive in low light and minimal watering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Snake plants are also known for their air-purifying properties, as
            they help remove toxins like formaldehyde and benzene from the air.
            They're drought-tolerant and can thrive in a variety of conditions,
            making them ideal for homes and offices.

          <h3>Aloa</h3>
          <p>
            The Aloe plant, commonly known as Aloe Vera, is a succulent that has
            thick, fleshy leaves containing a gel-like substance. It is
            well-known for its medicinal and cosmetic properties, particularly
            for its soothing, healing, and moisturizing effects. Aloe Vera gel
            is often used to treat minor burns, wounds, and skin irritations.

          <h3>Monstera</h3>
          <p>
            Monstera is a popular tropical plant known for its large, glossy,
            and uniquely split leaves. It is often called the "Swiss Cheese
            Plant" because of the natural holes and slits that develop in its
            leaves as it matures. Native to the rainforests of Central and South
            America, Monstera is a climbing plant that can grow very large under
            the right conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monstera is a popular indoor plant due to its striking appearance
            and relatively low maintenance. It thrives in indirect sunlight and
            requires moderate watering. The plant can also help improve indoor
            air quality by filtering toxins from the air.

          <p>
            Ants are social insects that live in well-organized colonies, often
            consisting of a queen, worker ants, and males. The queen's primary
            role is reproduction, while worker ants gather food, care for the
            queen, and maintain the nest. Ants communicate using pheromones,
            which help them create food trails, signal danger, or guide others.
            They're also incredibly strong, with some species capable of
            carrying objects many times their body weight.

            wings. Found in various environments, they have diverse diets,
            including plants, decaying matter, and other insects. Beetles
            undergo complete metamorphosis, moving through egg, larva, pupa, and
            adult stages. They play important roles in ecosystems by decomposing
            material, pollinating plants, and controlling pests.

            Butterflies are colorful, flying insects known for their beauty and
            transformation. They go through four life stages: egg, larva
            (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. Butterflies feed on
            nectar from flowers and are important pollinators. They are found in
            various habitats and are a key part of ecosystems, helping plants
            reproduce and serving as food for other animals.

        <div class="info_3-box">
          <h3>Fly</h3>
          <p>
            Flies are small, fast insects with a single pair of wings, belonging
            to the order *Diptera*. They are found almost everywhere and
            reproduce rapidly. Flies feed on various substances like decaying
            organic matter and sugary liquids. Some species, like houseflies,
            can spread diseases, while others, like fruit flies, are useful in
            scientific research.
